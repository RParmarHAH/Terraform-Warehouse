-- NAME:  Employee_Derived_Monthly_Metrics_By_Service_Line
--
-- PURPOSE: Creates derived monthly metrics by service line (HH, HC, CLS) for each employee based on visit/service data
--          NOTE: this table could have multiple entries for each employee in a given month because they could have served
--                clients who have different service line contracts.
